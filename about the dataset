🔗 HOW THESE FEATURES ARE RELATED
1. Songs & Artists

id_songs and id_artists link songs to their creators.

Each song has a corresponding artist (name_artists, id_artists), and artists can have multiple songs.

popularity_songs often correlates with popularity_artist, but not always — a less popular artist might have a hit song.

2. Popularity & Audio Features

Songs with higher danceability, energy, or valence might be more popular because they are more engaging or feel-good.

On the other hand, acoustic or instrumental tracks may have niche popularity.

3. Artist Metrics

followers, genres, and popularity_artist describe the artist's overall reach and appeal.

These can help explain why a song might gain traction quickly (famous artist = more likely to go viral).

4. Mood and Emotion

valence, mode, tempo, energy, danceability work together to define the mood of a song.

You can cluster songs into "happy", "sad", "chill", or "hype" playlists using these values.

5. Temporal Patterns

release_date can be used to study trends over time:

Are songs getting shorter?

Is there a rise in danceable music?

Do certain genres trend at different times?
